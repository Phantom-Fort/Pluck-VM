Pluck VM solution


Operating System: Ubuntu
Machine Name: Pluck

Analysis:
    1. Performed netdiscover Scan to discover the machine’s IP

    2. Then I performed a basic nmap scan to see active ports.

    3. HTTP port is open, so I opened the page on my browser.

I found out nothing of interest on the source code, so I continued to dig deeper.

    4. I then performed a basic directory enumeration using gobuster and the big.txt wordlist.

![Directory enumeration](./images/4.png)

I found a directory named /pluck

    5. I opened the directory on my browser.

    6. I found a log on page on /pluck. But it requires a password which we do not have.

    7. I then carried out a directory enumeration using dirb on kali linux.

    8. I found some nice-looking directories that we need to look into.

    9.  On opening the robots.txt file I found an Interesting file named /s3cr3t.txt. then we opened that directory.

![/s3cr3t.txt](./images/9.png)

    10. Then I used this login info to sign in on the /login.php

Unfortunately, there exist nothing Interesting, But Pluck 4.7.16 is Vulnerable to Local File Injection

    11. Pluck 4.7.16 Exploit — https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50826

    12. Let’s use the Vulnerability to Inject a Reverse Shell into the Machine

    13. I then download the rev_shell.py and shell.tar from https://github.com/Cyberw1ng/Bug-Bounty

    14. I performed a command on the web shell.

    15. then I set up a netcat listener on port 2929.

    16. Then I used the reverse shell command on the web shell.
